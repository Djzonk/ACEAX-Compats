A Ever growing collection of compats for [ACE3 Arsenal Extended](https://github.com/jetelain/AceArsenalExtended)  
Contributions are always welcome!

## How to Contribute
### How to make a new compat
1. Copy the `template_component` from the `extras` folder to the main directory.
2. Rename it an appropriate name to represent what mod the compat is for.  
**Keep Each Compat To One Mod or mod of the same family i.e. NIArms**  
3. Replace the following placeholder names.  
  -`TMPL_mod_name` name for the compat i.e. `ACEAX NIArms SCAR Compat`  
  -`TMPL_mod_prefix` prefix for the compat (no spaces) i.e. `aceax_niarms_compat`

You will need [HEMTT Version: 0.10 Alpha 16](https://github.com/BrettMayson/HEMTT/releases/tag/v0.10.0-a16)
1. Put the Hemtt in the compat folder right next to the config.cpp
